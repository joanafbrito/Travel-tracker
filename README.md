# Travel Tracker - Mod2 Final Project

## Abstract

The Travel Tracker website allows a user to login and see their own dashboard whith: 

- Trips : upcoming and past 
- The total amount spent with those trips during the current year.  

The user can also add another trip by:

- choosing a date,  
- the number of travelers and 
- the destination (from a list) 

And then see the estimated cost and the pending trip on their dashboard.

## A Little bit about the Developer

Hi! My name is Joana and I am a current Front End Engineering student at Turing School of Software Design. I am a career changer! I've  spent the last decade working to manage two small business, and grabbing the opportunity to move to another country. 
Now, I'm spending my days learning code. As a woman I can contribuit to build a more balanced society, where people can be seen as equals in the software marketing and where I can build apps more inclusive and make a difference using this huge platform of the internet!

## Learning Goals

Project Spec: [link](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html "Spec")

Work with GitHub projects as a project board
Work with an API to GET and POST data
Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
Solidify the code review process

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS/SaSS
- Lighthouse (Accessibility dev-tool)
- Vanilla JavaScript 
- Mocha & Chai (Testing tools)
- NPM package/Webpack
- Fetch API 
- ESLint

The src directory contains the classes and the testing files are in the test directory. 
The Fetch calls are contained in the fetch.js 
The updateDom.js file works with all the scripts.js, classes, & index.html files to render the page's dashboard.

## Setup

Fork this repo (look up in the top right corner) and copy the SSH link.
Open your terminal, run git clone (replace the [ ] with the copied remote address)
Change into the directory and type the following to view page: 

In the terminal run:

```bash
npm start
```

and then:

src/open index.html

## Wins

- Being able to put together everything that I have learned the last 5 weeks into action!

## Challenges

- Balancing this project while studying for the final assessment.
- Getting the Fetch requests to work.

## Future Designs/Extensions

**Add Agent Interaction:** 

- Add a travel agency, with login whith username and password 
- New trip requests (a user’s “pending” trips)
- Total income generated this year (should be 10% of user trip cost)
- Travelers on trips of the day (today's date)
